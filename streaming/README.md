# Nxtrad Stream SDK

This SDK is compatible with Node js version greater than 14

Dependencies are,

1. [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
2. [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws)

- Dowloaded zip file sdk will have below files inside stream directory

```
    lib/
    example.ts
    package.json
    tsconfig.json
```

- execute `npm install` from SDK directory to install all of its dependencies.
- execute `npm run build` to compile sample `example.ts` to javascript, then execute `node example.js`

## Authorization

- Nxtrad stream requires 'authToken' for authorization.
- AuthToken is a combination of APIkey and accessToken in the format '<APIkey>:<accessToken>'
- APIKey - In order to get the API key, please register at developer portal [https://api.tradejini.com/developer-portal/auth/login]. Once you register with developer portal, an application should be created to generate the API key.
- accessToken - Access token can be received in the response of access-token service or individual token service. Refer API doc website [https://api.tradejini.com/api-doc/] for more details.

- In case if the authtoken is expired or invalid you will get Close message with code "4001" and message as "Unauthorized Access".

In case if you have apikey and access token handy. Please form the authtoken and subscribe for prices else generate it from developer portal api document  [https://api.tradejini.com/api-doc/].

## Streaming Symbol Logic
    Nxtrad stream requires streaming symbol for price subscription. Stream symbol is a combination of exchangeToken and exchangeName in the format <exchangeToken>_<exchangeName>

    exchangeToken - 'excToken' field received from ScripMaster Data API response.
    exchangeName -  exchangeName should be retrieved from the field 'ID'  which is received from ScripMaster Data API response.

 For Example: For ACC NSE symbol, stream symbol would be '22_NSE'

    - Exchange token '22' received from the field 'excToken' 
    - Exchange Name should be retrieved from ID like below,

    For ACC, the ID received from scripmaster data api is EQT_ACC_EQ_NSE (Reference: <idFormat from API : INSTRUMENT_SYMBOL_SERIES_EXCHANGE>)

    The ID should be split using the character underscore'_' and the last string would be retrieved as exchange 'NSE'

    Each Id format mentioned in ScripMaster Groups API Split the 'id' field based on the format provided and use the fields such as exchange, basesymbol, expiry, optionType, Strike Price etc.

 As like above example you can frame streamSymbol list. Socket implementation and how to subscribe for prices details are given below,

## Implementation

- connect will create socket connection for host with particular auth Token.
- While connect using NxtradeStream Object there is a option for enabling and disabling symbolStore. To support for OptionChain subcriptions. And this option is enabled then it will take its own time to load Symbol store before connect.
- subscribeL1 will send level 1 request and provides you data apart from market depth.
- subscribeL1SnapShot will send level 1 snapshot request and provides you snapshot [A last tick data with all fields only once] data apart from market depth.
- subscribeL2 will send level 2 request and provides you data for market depth.
- subscribeL2SnapShot will send level 2 request and provides you snapshot data for market depth.
- subscribeGreeks will send Option greeks request and provides you Option Greeks data.
- subscribeGreeksSnapShot will send Option greeks request and provides you Option Greeks snapshot data.
- subscribeEvents will send a request for an events subscription and provides you the data when subscribed event is triggered. Example change in order status, Change in positions etc.
- subscribeOHLC will send OHLC request with symbol list, interval and provides you OHLC, Volume, time for the particular minute.
- subscribeOptionChain will send level 1 request with complete Option Chain for the underlyingId, and Expiry.
- For underLyingId refer ScripMaster Api from the api doc with coloum tagged as "undId". And refer Streaming Symbol Logic topic for how to extract Expiry From ID.
- unSubscribeL1, unSubscribeL2, unSubscribeEvents, unSubscribeGreeks, unSubscribeOHLC and unSubscribeOptionChain your unsubcribe the request made priorly respectively.

- Note : if this loadSymbolStore Option is enabled in NxtradeStream object then only OptionChain will be loaded. And it makes connect call slow.

### Note :
    If your are subscribing for some scrips. On next new subscription request the old symbols subscribed will be unsubscribed and only newer subscription list will be taken into count.
    Example : let say on first subscription Symbols [A, B, C, D] are sent . On subsequent subscription request you are sending [E, F].
    Now only E and F will get streamed [A, B, C, D] are unsubscribed.
    
    **if you are calling unsubscribeL1 then all l1 Subscriptions including optionChain subscribed by you also getUnsubscribed. If you are calling unsubscribeOptionChain other l1 Subscrption made by you will be persisted.**

    **if you are calling unsubscribeOHLC then all OHLC Subscriptions made by you only for the particular interval will be unsubscribed other interval subscriptions made by you will be persisted.**

- disconnect will close the socket connection.
- reconnect will create new connection based on the auth Token which passed for connect.
- stream_cb is the method where you get the subscribed streaming response in the data. Here we used it for printing you can use the same as per your wish. Kindly refer below Fields description for response fields.
- connect_cb will transfer the status of socket along with message. Kindly refer below Message description for socket status and message.
